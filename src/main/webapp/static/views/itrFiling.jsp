				<h2 align="center">Steps in filing your Income Tax Return</h2>
				<p>1. Collect your TDS certificates, which have to be
					mandatorily in TRACES format, from all deductors. In case of
					digitally signed TDS certificates ensure that there is a check mark
					on the digital signature indicating it has been verified.
					Non-verified certificates will have a question mark over the
					digital signature. Cross check the TDS figure on the certificate
					with that shown as deducted from your income e.g. TDS figure on
					salary slip with the figure on the TDS certificate. Check whether
					deduct .</p>
				<p>2. Download your tax credit statement (Form 26AS) from TRACES
					and cross-check the amount of tax deducted with that mentioned in
					TDS certificates. You should be getting certificates for all TDS
					reflecting in your Form26AS and all the TDS from your income should
					reflect in Form26AS. You need to log into your e-filing account on
					the income tax e-filing website to download your Form26AS. You can
					also download it via net-banking wherever the bank provides for
					this.</p>
				<p>3. In case of any difference in the TDS amount shown in Form
					26AS and TDS certificates, take up the matter with the deductor
					(employer, or others, as the case may be) and request for
					rectification.</p>
				<p>4. Now compute your total income for the relevant financial
					year by adding income under all 5 heads and claiming all the
					relevant deductions, rebates and setting-off the current year and
					brought forward losses. Make sure that you don't miss any income in
					computing your total income which is chargeable to tax.</p>
				<p>5. Compute your tax liability by applying the applicable tax
					rates in force for the financial year for which you are calculating
					the tax - FY2015-16 for most filers.</p>
				<p>6. Next compute your final tax dues payable or refund of
					taxes. This is done by deducting the taxes that you have already
					paid for the year by way of - TDS, TCS, and Advance Tax from the
					tax liability computed above and adding interest payable under
					sections 234A, 234B, 234C, if any. Finally pay the final tax dues,
					if any. Tax can be paid physically via cheque or online using
					challan ITNS 280. Income tax payments made after 15th March of the
					financial year for which return is to be filed are cal ..</p>
				<p>7. Once you have paid your taxes, file the return. The
					deadline for filing individual tax returns ( except for those whose
					accounts are required to be audited as per section 44AB or those
					who are required to furnish the Transfer pricing report) is
					normally July 31 of the year immediately after the financial year
					for which the return is being filed.</p>
				<p>8. To e-file the return, log in to income tax department's
					e-filing website with User ID, Password, Date of Birth and enter
					the Captcha Code. Once you login, you will see different tabs like
					"dashboard", "my Account" etc.</p>
				<p>9. In case of new user - Register yourself with income tax
					site first. You need to choose your status (individual, chartered
					accountant, tax deductor etc.) and fill in your basic details like
					address, DOB, PAN to get registered. Only then you can log in to
					e-filing.</p>
				<p>10. After signing in, choose the form applicable to you for the purpose of filing return.</p>
